Learned basic Github/Gitkraken/Markdown/Bookdown elements
Still need to acccess the student package for github

__*Lab*__

  - 6 different marine media are now in 125 mL flasks in 60 mL quantities
    -A1F
    - Marine NZSG
    - Chitin (shrimp chitin used)
    - CGS (used tryptic soy broth)
    - ISP2 fresh bfe + c
    - TB (terrific broth)
    
  - streaked marine plates of 137A-25 // K1164(70) and 139B-15 // K1088(66)
  - waiting for response on strain 114E-7 // kineo
  
## 08-14-2019

  - restreaked K1164 onto marine plate and K1088 into flask into A1F media
  - streaked from cryovials onto A1F plates and left at 37 degrees C
    - 131A-2 // K1214
    - 118C-2 // K1174
    - 128A-46 // K1040
    
## 08-16-2019
  - 6 different marine media 2 flasks each
  - A1M and A1F plates made (1 sleeve each)
  - 6 different freshwater media dry ingredients for 500 mL
  - no growth in flask or plate
  
## 08-21-2019
  - 6 different freshwater media finished for 5 flasks
    - 200 mL leftover for each media was left on bench
    - some 60 mL flasks on Chase's bench (ran out of room)
  - no further growth on plates (the heating incubator was found turned off, was turned back on today)
  - a bit of growth observed in flask
  - took K1174 out of incubator into room temp
  - streaked from the K1088 flask onto A1F plate, placed in 37 incubator

## 08-23-2019
  - no new growth observed on agar plates
  - restreaked K1164, K1214, K1174, and K1040 onto respective agar plates 
    - M, F, M, F
    - waited for cryovials to melt longer
    - used parafilm
    - left K1174 on bench at room temp, others in 37 incubator
    - ones without the old code 
      - thawed completely, vortexed, pipetted 40 uL and streak with sterile loop
    
*separate note*

  - 24 well plates in the order of
    - TB, CGS, ISP2, NZSG, A1, Chitin
    - pink tape marks the top 
    
## 08-26-2019
  - K1174 grew at room temp on agar plate so now in A1M liquid media on shaker
    - will need to make more A1M liquid media most likely
  - pulled other strains (besides K1088) into room temp as well on bench
  - K1088 plate did not grow but left in 37 degree incubator
  
*Organizational Purposes*
cryovial --> agar plate --> liquid media flask --> agar plate for purification

| Agar 1 | Liquid Media | Agar 2 | Purified Strain |
| ------ | ------------ | ------ | --------------- |
| K1214  | K1174        | K1088  |                 |
| K1040  |              |        |                 |
| K1164  |              |        |                 |

Check this table may not be right

## 08-28-2019
  - 1088 --> restreaking onto 2nd plate from liquid M
  - 1040 --> dumping whole cryovial F
  - 1214 --> putting into liquid media from uniform F
  - 1164 --> Jeongho M
  - 1174 --> streaking onto 2nd plate from liquid M
  

| Agar 1    | Liquid Media | Agar 2    | Purified Strain |
| ------    | ------------ | ------    | --------------- |
|           | K1174 (M)    | K1088 (M) |                 |
|           | K1040 (F)    | K1174 (M) |                 |
| K1164 (M) | K1214 (F)    |           |                 |

## 09-09-2019

| Agar 1    | Liquid Media | Agar 2    | Purified Strain |
| ------    | ------------ | ------    | --------------- |
| K1088 (M) |              | K1040 (F) |                 |
|           |              | K1214 (F) |    K1174 (M)    |
| K1164 (M) |              |           |                 |
 

  - K1174 from 8-28 is pure
  - K1088 had two strains in it so restreaked from cryovial onto new agar plate (pipette with 50 uL)
  - K1164 will be donated by Jeongho
  
  
## 09-13-2019
  
    - K1214 looks pure 
    - K1040 grown on A1F liquid media (whole cryovial) did not grow on A1F agar plate or in the media 
    - K1088 into liquid media (M)
