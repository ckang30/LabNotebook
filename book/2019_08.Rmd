__*Lab*__

  - 6 different marine media are now in 125 mL flasks in 60 mL quantities
    -A1F
    - Marine NZSG
    - Chitin (shrimp chitin used)
    - CGS (used tryptic soy broth)
    - ISP2 fresh bfe + c
    - TB (terrific broth)
    
  - streaked marine plates of 137A-25 // K1164(70) and 139B-15 // K1088(66)
  - waiting for response on strain 114E-7 // kineo
  
## 08-14-2019

  - restreaked K1164 onto marine plate and K1088 into flask into A1F media
  - streaked from cryovials onto A1F plates and left at 37 degrees C
    - 131A-2 // K1214
    - 118C-2 // K1174
    - 128A-46 // K1040
    
## 08-16-2019
  - 6 different marine media 2 flasks each
  - A1M and A1F plates made (1 sleeve each)
  - 6 different freshwater media dry ingredients for 500 mL
  - no growth in flask or plate
  
## 08-21-2019
  - 6 different freshwater media finished for 5 flasks
    - 200 mL leftover for each media was left on bench
    - some 60 mL flasks on Chase's bench (ran out of room)
  - no further growth on plates (the heating incubator was found turned off, was turned back on today)
  - a bit of growth observed in flask
  - took K1174 out of incubator into room temp
  - streaked from the K1088 flask onto A1F plate, placed in 37 incubator

## 08-23-2019
  - no new growth observed on agar plates
  - restreaked K1164, K1214, K1174, and K1040 onto respective agar plates 
    - M, F, M, F
    - waited for cryovials to melt longer
    - used parafilm
    - left K1174 on bench at room temp, others in 37 incubator
    
*separate note*

  - 24 well plates in the order of
    - TB, CGS, ISP2, NZSG, A1, Chitin
    - pink tape marks the top
